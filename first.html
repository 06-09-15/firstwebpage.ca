  <h1>What is a hardware</h1>
  <p>Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer. Computer Hardware is any part of the computer that we can touch these parts. These are the primary electronic devices used to build up the computer. Examples of hardware in a computer are the Processor, Memory Devices, Monitor, Printer, Keyboard, Mouse, and the Central Processing Unit.</p>

  <h2 id="web-The relationship between hardware and software"></h2>
  <h1>The relationship between hardware and software</h1>
  <p>Hardware and software are different from each other, but they also need one another in order to function. For example of using a mobile phone. In this case, the hardware would be the physical phone itself, and the software would be its operating system and apps.

If we were to take away the software, we would just have a dead phone in our hands. It wouldn't be able to make calls, text, or go online because it's not receiving any instructions.</p>
