  <h1>What is HTML</h1>
  <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a form of programming code used to instruct a browser to create the structure for individual web pages on a website. This markup language is a fundamental component of how billions of people perceive and consume pages on the internet. HTML is responsible for things like text representation, defining visual format, providing search engines with page context and designating sections of a page.</p>

  <h1>What is HTML used for</h1>
  <p>HTML is a written markup language used to annotate text, images and other content in a structured manner for display on the internet.

HTML is used to provide structure to a webpage and make it accessible to users of the internet through text, visual formatting and search factors. It is commonly known as the most basic building block of the web, working alongside CSS and JavaScript to create the websites we see while browsing.

HTML, particularly its most recent form, is a highly capable programming language with a variety of uses when it comes to web browsing and data. Not only do we use HTML for web page development, web document creation and internet navigation, HTML5 introduces advanced APIs, facilitates client-side storage via localStorage and IndexDB, offers data entry support, facilitates offline application use through caching and can even be used in game development.</p>

  <h1>What is CSS used for</h1>
  <p>CSS used to add style to a web page by dictating how a site is displayed on a browser. CSS is unique in that it doesn’t create any new elements, like HTML. Instead, it’s a language used to style HTML elements.

CSS is responsible for the text style, size, positioning, color, and more on a website. It’s also what controls how a website’s style shifts between desktop and mobile versions. Without CSS, websites would look pretty boring.</p>
